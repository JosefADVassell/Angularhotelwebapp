# Angularhotelwebapp
A Web Application for hotel registration, built using Angular. This app manages the hotel, bookings, and customer details and uses Mockoon to simulate API responses during development. The Point of the Project was for me to learn more about Angular and its dependencies and using Mockoon to to simulate API with a backend response.
